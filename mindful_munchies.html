                <p>This soup was soo delicious! We had a fresh whole chicken gifted to us through a coworker, and this soup includes leftovers of the whole roasted bird. This makes the soup a great way to use up leftovers! 
                We used the Green Anime Girl Ramen that i don't know the name of. While the noodles boiled, we added the seasoning, frozen or leftover kale, and the chicken pieces. Once served, sprinkle with lime, spicy chili crisp, and whatever else you'd like! Easy and very filling :3</p>
