I think what I want to do is: 

## Index Page

Holy shit nav bears 

I want to do a more comprehensive portal, that has an identifying icon or section that leads to that page.  

Example Ideas:
A cute bear image that when clicked leads to the page for cute bear pictures. 
Maybe a cutesy image of a room, and the items lead to different things? Like old school flash games!!! 
Clicking on the computer leads to the blog; Clicking the stereo leads to my music, etc? 

## Piped Dreams
Triple entendre, piped as in high, piped as in whipped cream, and piped as in pipe dream. This would be grand projects that I would love to do, but need a lot more experience to tackle. Example: Creating a controller for PJSK and Groove Coaster on the computer, a full wardrobe of self made clothes, etc; 

## Blog Page
A very simple blog page, probably cutesy, with simply laid out article boxes in a nice calming color. 

## Bear Pics
Again, very simple layout of endless scroll of adorable bears. Maybe I have tags and search options for like cute bears, stuffed bears, etc. So I can have a place to post (and properly source) bear images that i like. bc they are so cute

## Music Page

This one would be a little emo in theme, leaning more into purple :3c Basically to post spotify playlists and maybe a blog or two about music

## Projects Page

I think we could go cutesy, but maybe green/frog/etc and I would like to post information about things i'm working on and pictures
