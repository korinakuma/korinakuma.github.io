                You can't sleep. You haven't slept for a day now. You're on the balcony, minding a cigarette. It's well below freezing but you're not that cold. You've wrapped yourself in a thick throw blanket, with socks to match. 
                You don't even like smoking cigarettes, but you appreciate the alone time. Your side of the city was peaceful. The usual roaring of traffic was absent. A thick layer of fresh snow quieted the earth. The sky, black in the late night, overcast. In a few minutes, and she will watch her second sunrise in two days.

                So you take a deep breath of smoke. You've been getting better at it. Who are you trying to impress?
                You don't think you know the answer to that. You don't think there's a right answer anymore. 
                You watch the big, clumpy flakes fall as they're lit by the streetlamp. Your head buzzes. You wonder if the nausea is worth it. 
                The world will soon start to wake. You feel more alone than you have ever felt. You're starting to think maybe you deserve it. 
                But you stay awake to see another sunrise.
