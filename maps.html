        <h1>Learning About Map Concepts</h1>
        <p>I came across this game, and wanted to explore the map concepts that the author talked about in his HN post about his game. 
            <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40740021" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to the article. </p>
        <h2>What are the topics we're exploring?</h2>
        <p>In his article, he makes the following statement: - I had to draw semi accurate maps of actual places (UK, South America, US west coast) in the HTML canvas using just line segments. I tried a few different solutions, including using SVG data. I ended up using the topojson library to give nice line approximations to GeoJSON maps</p>
        <p>Here are the individual topics in that statement that I didn't understand and wanted to explore.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drawing in the HTML canvas using line segments</li>
            <li>Using GeoJSON vs SVG data in this project</li>
            <li>What is topojson?</li>
        </ul>
